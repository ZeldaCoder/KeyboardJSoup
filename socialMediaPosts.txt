There is little to no arch support so be prepared for a super flat shoe. But I don't plan on hiking in these, the style is what I wanted., Date: October 13, 2024

2) User: GsMom, Rating: 5.0, Review: While I love the look of these vans, especially in the beige color, the tongue of the shoe will not stay in the middle. It veers to the side and it's so annoying., Date: March 29, 2024

5) User: Kristin, Rating: 5.0, Review: Dope! Really cool they didn't really show the detail online so I took a chance just because they got marked down because they are calling them a Halloween shoe, but they're really cool I'll take a video it's got embroidered on everything all black and it's got embroidered black roses on the side and it's got lace as in like lingerie lace laces, Date: November 29, 2024

He got me wearing them as my daily shoes because they're so comfortable. Only downside is I thought they were more of a brighter pink, they're slightly darker than the images but that's OK! They're still a beautiful color! I work at a school and go to college right after work so I'm on my feet all day and I never have a problem with foot pain! There's even leather around the opening so it's softer on your ankles than fabric., Date: October 20, 2024

I wear a 6.5 but got a 7 and they fit perfectly(have wide feet). Comfortable to walk in. Complements since I walked out the door and I will HIGLY RECOMMEND IT! MEN love this color as well., Date: September 10, 2024

10) User: Cat, Rating: 5.0, Review: My crocs used to be my favorite shoes but after a few times wearing these they quickly took the place of my crocs as my go to shoes. The style is effortless. Comfort is a solid 7. They stain rather quickly but it's nothing that routine cleaning won't fix. They crease quickly as well but shoes with a sidewall like that will always crease. My converse crease the same way so it's not just these. Still love em tho. They go with anything too., Date: July 22, 2024

21) User: Deo, Rating: 5.0, Review: The past couple of years vans haven't felt the same. I tried switching styles and sizes but nothing gave me that same new vans feeling you would get back in the 2000s. Until this pair. 100% back to exactly what you remember., Date: July 10, 2024

24) User: Steve, Rating: 5.0, Review: First, major fan of Vans footwear. I use this particular pair for more dressier occasions. These pair well with my khakis and matching shirts. Very comfortable shoe, very supportive. A bit snugger than I prefer, though. This is interesting because it's the same size and style of the Bugee Cord pair I recently purchased, also in the Old Skool, but nevertheless, it is still a great product., Date: July 4, 2024
